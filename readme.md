> create and publish your own maps

### 📍 Sick of static maps?
maps need to be as dynamic as the RPG games you play.

Stargazer allows you to customize locations while also benefiting from a wealth of base map data. This is because Stargazer comes with all the known official data points pre-generated.

Just add your unofficial points and publish
