# 🗺️ Stargazer
> create and publish your own Sci-Fi map

## 👉 [Start Stargazing](https://stargazer.vercel.app)

### 🤔 Why?
Most maps are just static images. These have a few issues

- rendering a new image is usually done locally and is inefficient
- the styling from image maps won't match everyone's preference

By creating a data driven map, all downstream uses of it become improved.
This is because the project will release a free TopoJSON file.
Which (given it respects copyright) can be used for your next app.

### ✨ Yet Another Stylized Map
> not interested in programming or manually handling map data?

In addition to the goal of consolidating map data. I will be creating my own stylized version of select maps. Click the link at the top to see it.

If you want to create your own map. Or just make general use of the TopoJSON I'd recommend picking up [maplibre](https://maplibre.org). Then using my code as an example.
