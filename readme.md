# üó∫Ô∏è Stargazer
> create and publish your own Sci-Fi map

## üëâ [Start Stargazing](https://stargazer.vercel.app)

### ü§î Why?
Most maps are just static images. These have a few issues

- rendering a new image is usually done locally and is inefficient
- the styling from image maps won't match everyone's preference

By creating a data driven map, all downstream uses of it are improved.
This is because the project will release a free TopoJSON & GeoJSON file (common map specs).

### ‚ú® Yet Another Stylized Map
> not interested in programming or manually handling map data?

In addition to the goal of consolidating map data. I will be creating my own stylized version of the Lancer map. Click the link at the top to see it.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal
Stargazer is not an official Lancer product; it is a third party work, and is not affiliated with Massif Press. Stargazer is published via the Lancer Third Party License.
